Release Notes

v0.10.2

## Fix:
- Process identification for non en-US Windows users
- Native Windows Multi-Instance Support (Should not mis-identify processes outside Instance Directory)


v.0.10.1

## New:
- Added Discord Bot launch status to Palworld Admin UI Console on Server Launch when Bot is enabled.

## Improved:
- Discord Bot will update presence once per minute rather than when it sends a message (should give better representation of player count)
- Discord Bot launch moved to Server Launch in code
- Discord Bot will not shutdown when server is shutdown from Palworld Admin 

## Fixed:
- Kicking and Banning via RCON has been fixed
- Fixed Discord bug causing DB to need to be deleted on every restart

v0.10.0
## New:
- Discord Initial Integration - Full, Built-In, Self Hosted Bot (Options under the new Palworld Admin Settings)
- Native Windows Multi-Instance - Palworld Admin should only detect its own instance of the Dedicated Server now, allowing you to create a copy of Palworld Admin in another directory if you want to run multiple instances (Beware of Palworld Dedicated Server being a resource hog)
- Tentative Fix for 0.2.0.6 Server breaking changes (Change of .exe name and missing steam files in Win64 directory)
- Added palworld-admin.log - now everything that goes into the console automatically goes into the log file as well to make debugging easier

## Improved:
- Re-arranged UI:
  - The Player List is now taller
  - Palworld Dedicated Server launcher settings are in the Server Settings
  - Palworld Admin Settings (Like Steam Authentication, Auto-Restart and Auto-Backup) are now in Palworld Admin Settings (Green Gear button)
  - Server Manager is now accessible via /admin endpoint (Making way for Custom Server pages on root / ). So to access your server via browser, go to https://ip:port/admin

v0.9.9

## New:
- Added --launch-server / -ls command line argument (launches the server immediately if server is installed and settings are stored for launching server successfully)
- Added --port / -p command line argument (Allows Palworld Admin to listen on a port other than 8210 - still the default)
- Added MANAGEMENT_PORT to wine docker image (for passing --port to Palworld Admin)
- When launched with -ls the webserver can restart a server after an unexpected shutdown even if no client is connected to the backend.

## Improved:
- Moved cli_parsing to settings script for earlier parsing
- Cleaned up much of the code (removed old unused pyinstaller references)

v0.9.8

## New:
- Created and Published Flask-OpenID-Steam (Patched Flask-OpenID) to pypi to be used on main project so pypi version is fixed
- Palguard Version bumped to 1.683 (Palguard Discord Release)

## Fixed:
- Rare situation where Palguard would not be properly detected while installed.

## Improved:
- Palguard Presence Detection (On RCON Connect)
- Refresh Settings on Server Data Import/Restore

v0.9.7

## Fixed:
- SteamAuth settings not applying when server is already running when Palworld Admin is launched

v0.9.6

## New:
- Join annoincements show if the user is authenticated and their IP

## Fixed:
- Error grabbing the steam_auth_ip from the database under certain scenarios

## Improved:
- Instead of running the auth on every RCON tick, run it only on player join

v0.9.5

Re-Release of 0.9.4 to fix bugs that had already made its way to pypi

v0.9.4

## New:
- Steam SSO Authentication (Prevents SteamIDs that have not been authenticated directly with Steam from connecting to the server)
- Steam SSO + IP Authentication (Requires Palguard) - Requires that both the SteamID be authenticated, and the player IP match the IP that was used for Authentication

To use Auth, tell your players to visit http://[ipofyourserver]:8210/steam-auth (You are welcome and encouraged to use an SSL for your Palworld Admin Webserver, but it's up to you how you go about it)

## Fixed:
- Player Joins and Leaves being announced again on Palwolrd Admin UI

v0.9.3

## New:
- RCON Command Dropdown: Automatically detects Palguard and displays all commands available
- RCON Command Field: Automatically displays Palguard command descriptions
- You can also click on Player Names, UIDs and SteamIDs to automatically paste the respective values into the RCON command field

## Fixes:
- RCON not using pgbroadcast in place of broadcast when Palguard is installed has been fixed

v0.9.2

## New:
- First release with Docker Support (Self Updating Palworld Admin + Wine - dockerhub image address coming later after final tests) 
- New Button: Install UE4SS (Automatically installs latest version from Github)
- New Button: Install Palguard (Automatically installs latest version from Discord releases -has to be manually updated in Palworld Admin since there's no way to do an automatic version check on discord)


v0.9.1

## Fixes:
- Error when launching with --management-password flag

v0.9.0

## New:
- New Implementation for Server Shutdown mechanic (Should resolve issues for users where their servers take unreasonably long to shutdown)
- Compilation to Windows using Nuitka instead of Pyinstaller
- First release using a Full Installer. So now there's only 1 download to be made for windows, which gives you the ability to choose whether to install the UI or not, and the different shortcuts created by the installer determine how the app will be launched.
Please **PAY CLOSE ATTENTION DURING THE INSTALLER SO YOU BECOME FAMILIAR WITH THE SHORTCUTS**.
- Introduction of Early Access releases for Project supporters (Priority access will be given to those helping support my time - about 300 hours so far - put towards the app). For clarity, fixes will be released as soon as possible to everyone, new features will be released as early access to supporters for at least 24 hours.

## Fixes:
- Server Shutdown and Restart should work much better now
- UI Elements that were not being disabled while the server was running should now be disabled

## **IMPORTANT:**
- There's no binary release for Linux on this version as I'm working on the compilation process for nuitka on linux. A release may be posted later, but for now, you can still install on linux via `pip install palworld-admin`

v0.8.9
## New:
- Initial Palguard Integration:
  - Run the addtional palguard commands directly from Palworld Admin
  - It will use pgbroadcast automatically in place of regular broadcast for sending messages via RCON (so spaces will look like normal spaces)
  - If you have enables base64 encoding, Palworld ADMIN will automatically recognize it and use it, meaning that all the issues related to non-latin characters in player names are solved
